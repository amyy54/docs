# Home

Hello! This is my documentation website! The purpose of this website is to
catalog various writeups I've done over the years for how to accomplish various
weird computing tasks. Most of this work is very simple, and may be inaccurate
or incomplete. Either way, this is meant to be a casual documentation store for
public notes that gets updated slowly over time.

## Who am I

My professional career is primarily focused on Cybersecurity, though I do a lot
of software development in my free time. Most of my public work in the software
developemnt area will be documented on my [homepage](https://amyy.me). This
website will instead contain casual writeups focused on how I fixed technical
problems, or just my thoughts put onto a page.

## One last note

I have a bad habit of forgetting to write things down. This site exists to
hopefully curb that. To be effective in that regard, I want to make this site as
low stress as possible. As such, whatever's written on this site may be: out of
date; inaccurate; and/or useless. Most everything that will be written here are
loose notes for me to look back on later, and is not intended to be the end all
be all "THIS IS HOW X WORKS". If some process I run through ends up not working
for you, this is my warning ahead of time.
